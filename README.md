# Covid19-Report
Reports shows the analysis of Covid 19 reports from 24-02-20 to 30-04-21.
# Project Name:  Covid 19 Report by Damilare Tiamiyu.
## Project Details
The dataset contains information about varrious indices including but not limited to the continents, location, dates,	population, total_cases, new_cases,	total_deaths, new_deaths, total vaccinated and many more.
The objective of this project is to use SQL to wrangle the data and answer the following questions and more:
* TOTAL CASES VS TOTAL DEATHS IN THE DATASET?
* TOTAL CASES VS POPULATION IN NIGERIA?
* HIGHEST INFECTION RATES CHECKED AGAINST POPULATION IN AFRICA ACROSS THE DATASET?
* HIGHEST DEATH COUNTS CHECKED AGAINST POPULATION IN AFRICA?
* THE NUMBER OF VACCINES RECEIVED IN EACH COUNTRY?
* COMPARING THE TOTAL POPULATION AGAINST THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE VACCINATED IN EACH COUNTRY

## Data collection: 
Dataset was gotten from GitHub.

## Data Cleaning
In this project, I didn't have to do some much in data cleaning except that I had to filter out the continents where necessary as part of the dataset contained continent designation ammong the location column even though there is a column for contient on its own.
I did this to avoid duplication of data.
 

## Data Exploration
After the data was cleaned, I prepared the data for exploration by splitting the data into covid deaths and covid vaccinations, performed EDA to explore answwers to the questions set in the objective of the project.

## Presentation of Findings
1. In the heart of Nigeria's battle against COVID-19, data reveals a story of resilience and challenges. With 165,110 reported cases and
2,063 lives lost, the nation faced the pandemic head-on. Remarkably, a calculated 1.25% death rate highlighted a populace determined to overcome adversity.

2. Beyond numbers, Nigeria's sheer population size emerged'as both a shield and a sword.
With an infection rate of 0.08%, the data reflected collective efforts that shielded a significant portion of its 206 million people.

3. Zooming out to the African continent, Seychelles, though smaller in population, faced a higher infection rate. The story unfolded - population size alone did not dictate the severity of the pandemic's impact.

4. Despite being the most populous nation, Nigeria ranked 10th in deaths, showcasing the resilience of a nation in the face of adversity. The lesson? High population didn't necessarily translate into higher mortality rates.

5. Shifting focus to vaccination efforts, Morocco led the way, while Nigeria secured the 8th spot. Challenges were evident, but the data hinted at resilience amidst vaccine distribution disparities.

6. In April 2022, Nigeria received 233,100 vaccines, signaling hope. A vaccination rate of 011% highlighted determination to overcome the crisis".
